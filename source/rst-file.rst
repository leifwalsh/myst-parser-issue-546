reStructuredText file
=====================

This file contains reStructuredText, which amazingly, is a misspelled word.
The same token in the heading above this is flagged as a misspelled word,
but is attributed to the row of equals signs below it on line 2.

.. note::

    A note between paragrphs doesn't make sphinxcontrib.spelling confused
    about which line contains the error. Also, the typo in this note is
    attributed to the correct line within this note.

This paragraph also has a typoed word. But it is correctly attributed to
this line.
