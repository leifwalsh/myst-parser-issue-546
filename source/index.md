This paragraph has a mispeld word. But that misspelling is attributed
to line "0" of this file.

```{warning}
Hi Docs, I'm Dad!
```

This paragraph contains no spelling errors. But as we'll see, the
paragraph below has an error but gets attributed to the beginning of
the warning above this paragraph.
